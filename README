NAME
    DBD::SQLite::Amalgamation - Single C-file based DBD::SQLite distribution

SYNOPSIS
      use DBI;
      my $dbh = DBI->connect("dbi:SQLite:dbname=dbfile","","");

DESCRIPTION
    This module is nothing but a stub for an experimental way to distribute
    Matt Sergeant's DBD::SQLite, using the concatenated C files (the
    *amalgamation*) as provided by the SQLite Consortium.

    As of version 3.5.8, the "FTS3" full-text search engine is now built by
    default.

SEE ALSO
    DBD::SQLite, where this module is derived from.
